AVR_Stick_Apps Quick Start Guide
================================

... THIS STILL IS A WORK IN PROGRESS !!! ...


0. Required Hardware
--------------------

This guide assumes you have a Sparkfun AVR Stick[1] or a compatible
device.
At the time of writing the AVR Stick is no longer available from
Sparkfun directly. There are some vendors who sell compatible clones.
Alternatively you can use the EAGLE[2] files provided by Sparkfun[3]
and have your own PCBs manufactures or you can even recreate the
necessary circuit on a breadboard. See HOWTO.txt for more information
on the Hardware options.

In addition to the AVR Stick hardware itself you will need a
programmer to flash the firmware or at least to initially flash the
micronucleus bootloader if you choose to use it.
One option would be to use and Arduino as a programmer for the
ATtiny[4].


1. Setting up the development environment
-----------------------------------------

To compile the examples avr-gcc and avr-libc are required.

For flashing the firmware we will use avrdude.

If you want to use an Arduino as a programmer, you will also
need the Arduino IDE.

1.1 Installation on Linux
-------------------------

The Arduino IDE (if required) can be downloaded from:
https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/Software

All the other required software should be available as
packages from your Linux distribution.

On Ubuntu the following command will install the
necessary packages:

 $ sudo apt-get install gcc-avr avr-libc avrdude binutils-avr


1.2 Installation on Windows
---------------------------

The Arduino IDE (if required) can be downloaded from:
https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/Software

Please see [5] for instructions on how to install the other
required software on Windows 10.


2. Installing the micronucleus bootloader
-----------------------------------------

To be able to update the firmware on the AVR Stick without
needing a separate programmer every time, we are going
to use the micronucleus[6] bootloader.
