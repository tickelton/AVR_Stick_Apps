AVR_Stick_Apps Quick Start Guide
================================


0. Required Hardware
--------------------

This guide assumes you have a Sparkfun AVR Stick[1] or a compatible
device.
See HOWTO.txt for more information on the Hardware options.

In addition to the AVR Stick hardware itself you will need a
programmer to initially flash the micronucleus bootloader.


1. Required Software
--------------------

To compile the examples an AVR GCC toolchain is required.

For flashing the firmware we will use avrdude.

On Linux libusb-0.1 is required to build the micronucleus
command line tool.

This guide uses an Arduino as a programmer[2], therefore you will
also need the Arduino IDE.


2. Getting the sources
----------------------

 $ git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/tickelton/AVR_Stick_Apps.git

Since the AVR_Stick_Apps repository contains references to all the
third party software we will use in the form of submodules, this
command gives us access to all the code we will need.


3. Building the micronucleus bootloader
---------------------------------------

 $ cd AVR_Stick_Apps
 $ make bootloader

   Building Micronucleus configuration: AVR_Stick
   Size of sections:
      text    data     bss     dec     hex filename
      1588       0      44    1632     660 main.bin
   Size of binary hexfile. Use the data size to calculate the bootloader address:
      text    data     bss     dec     hex filename
         0    1588       0    1588     634 main.hex

This command should leave you with the compiled bootloader in the
file 'AVR_Stick_Apps/submodules/micronucleus/firmware/main.hex'.


2. Installing the micronucleus bootloader
-----------------------------------------

First we need to set the fuses of the ATtiny85 correctly.
The following command assumes that an Arduino with the ArduinoISP
sketch is used as a programmer. Otherwise you need to adapt the
programmer parameters according to your setup.

 $ avrdude -p attiny85 -b 19200 -c arduino -P /dev/ttyUSB0 -U lfuse:w:0xe1:m -U hfuse:w:0xdd:m -U efuse:w:0xfe:m

After that we can flash the actual bootloader:

 $ cd AVR_Stick_Apps/submodules/micronucleus/firmware/
 $ avrdude -p attiny85 -b 19200 -c arduino -P /dev/ttyUSB0 -U flash:w:main.hex


3. Building the USBSlacker app
------------------------------

 $ cd AVR_Stick_Apps
 $ make USBSlacker
   ...
   AVR Memory Usage
   ----------------
   Device: attiny85

   Program:    2040 bytes (24.9% Full)
   (.text + .data + .bootloader)

   Data:         67 bytes (13.1% Full)
   (.data + .bss + .noinit)
   ...

Now you should have the compiled binary for the app in
AVR_Stick_Apps/apps/USBSlacker/src/USBSlacker.hex


4. Building the micronucleus command line tool
----------------------------------------------

On Windows you can skip this step as micronucleus comes
with a pre-compiled binary for Windows in:
AVR_Stick_Apps/submodules/micronucleus/commandline/builds/Windows/micronucleus.exe

On Linux you can build the tool with the following command:

 $ cd AVR_Stick_Apps
 $ make micronucleus

This results in the following file:
AVR_Stick_Apps/submodules/micronucleus/commandline/micronucleus


5. Flashing the app using micronucleus
--------------------------------------

Now you have all the necessary components to flash the newly built
app to your AVR Stick.

With the AVR Stick _NOT_ plugged in run the following commands:

 $ cd AVR_Stick_Apps
 $ sudo ./submodules/micronucleus/commandline/micronucleus --run apps/USBSlacker/src/USBSlacker.hex
   > Please plug in the device ...
   > Press CTRL+C to terminate the program.

The plug in the AVR Stick and the app will get flashed to the device:

   > Device is found!
   connecting: 33% complete
   > Device has firmware version 2.4
   > Device signature: 0x1e930b
   > Available space for user applications: 6522 bytes
   > Suggested sleep time between sending pages: 7ms
   > Whole page count: 102  page size: 64
   > Erase function sleep duration: 714ms
   parsing: 50% complete
   > Erasing the memory ...
   erasing: 66% complete
   > Starting to upload ...
   writing: 83% complete
   > Starting the user app ...
   running: 100% complete
   >> Micronucleus done. Thank you!

After 5 seconds the AVR Stick will automatically reboot into the newly
flashed app.


6. Enjoy
--------

At this point you have successfully turned your AVR Stick into an
USB mouse emulator that will wiggle the cursor every couple of minutes.

You can now try to also build and flash the other demo apps or
dive into HOWTO.txt to find out how to create your own ones.
